# Herd
A HTTP load testing suite written in Rust

This is very much experimental, not ready for production, or test driven whilst I learn my way around Rust and its ecosystem, I hope this project will however, turn into a stable, test driven application in the future.

Feel free to contribute via PRs.

###### Compile and Run
```shell
$ git clone git@github.com:imjacobclark/Herd.git && cd Herd
